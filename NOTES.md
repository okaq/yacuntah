### The Mayan "Hive Mind"

+ The Temple Pyramid served as the great central hub
+ It was the "broker" that could connect souls across great distances
+ The "soul" or consciousness was viewed more as an antennae
+ Contrast with our modern conception:
+ A physical collection of grey matter in the skull
